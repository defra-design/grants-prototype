    The RPA will contact you when the full application period opens. They will tell you if your project scored well enough to get the full application form.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you submit an application, the RPA will assess it against other projects and value for money. You will not automatically get a grant. The grant is expected to be highly competitive and you are competing against other projects.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your application is successful, you'll be sent a funding agreement and can begin work on the project.

  Starting the project or committing to any costs (such as placing orders) before you receive a funding agreement will invalidate your application.

          If you want your landlord to underwrite your project, you will need them to sign a letter of assurance. This letter will say your landlord agrees to take over your project, including conditions in the Grant Funding Agreement, if your tenancy ends. You should discuss and agree this with your landlord before you begin your full application.

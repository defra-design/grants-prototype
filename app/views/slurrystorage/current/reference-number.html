  <li>RPA will be in touch when the full application period opens to tell you if your project is invited to submit a full application form.</li>

   <p>If your project is invited to submit a full application, you need:</p>
     <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

       <li>a storage calculation plan, which you will need to submit for review to the Environment Agency</li>
       <li>confirmation that your project will comply with Water Resources (Control of Pollution) (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) regulations (SSAFO) and build standards (signed by you and your engineer)</li>
       <li>a nutrient management plan</li>
       <li>a declaration that you will comply with monitoring requirements</li>
     </ul>


  <li>If you submit an application, RPA will assess it against other projects and value for money. You will not automatically get a grant. The grant is expected to be highly competitive and you are competing against other projects. </li>
  <li>If your application is successful, you’ll be sent a funding agreement and can begin work on the project.</li>
</ol>

<p>Starting the project or committing to any costs (such as placing orders) before you receive a funding agreement will invalidate your application.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Before you start the project, you can:</p>

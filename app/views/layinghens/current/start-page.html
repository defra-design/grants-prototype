       <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>

        <li>
          adding a veranda to existing laying hen or pullet housing
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you are applying for housing grant funding, you can apply for up to 25% of the estimated costs of buying and installing a solar PV system which produces up to 5 kilowatts (kW) of energy output per 1,000 birds. 
      </p>

      <p>
        You can apply for grant funding for multiple house or veranda projects. You must submit an application for each project. You cannot apply for grant funding for both housing and veranda projects. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The maximum total grant amount each business can apply for is £500,000 for housing projects (including solar PV system costs) or £100,000 for veranda projects. The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) will award the grant funding for verandas on a first come, first served basis.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For housing projects, the minimum grant is £15,000 (40% of £37,500). For veranda projects, the minimum grant is £5,000 (40% of £12,500).

<p>You must have applied for planning permission before you submit a full application. Any planning permission must be in place by 31 December 2022.</p>
<p>You will invalidate your application if you start the project or commit to any costs (such as placing orders) before you receive a funding agreement.</p>
<p>Before you start the project, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get quotes from suppliers</li>
  <li>apply for planning permission (this can take a long time)</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply-for-a-grant">How to apply for a grant</h2>
<h3>Check if your project can apply for a grant</h3>
<p>You’ll need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>information about your business (for example, number of employees, turnover)</li>
  <li>information about the project (for example, the types of products being processed and how you will add value, the project impact)</li>
  <li>a list of the items you’d like to buy for the project</li>
  <li>an estimate of the total cost of the items</li>
</ul>

<p>After you have gone through the checker, you’ll get a score showing how well your project fits the funding priorities.</p>
<p>RPA wants to fund projects that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>improve processing and supply chains</li>
  <li>improve the environment</li>
  <li>encourage collaboration and partnerships</li>
  <li>grow your business</li>
</ul>

<p>When you are happy with your score, you can submit your details to the RPA.</p>
<p>You can go back through the checker as many times as you like but you can only submit your details once.</p>

<p class="call-to-action"><a href="start" class="govuk-link--no-visited-state">Check if your project can apply for a grant.</a></p>

<h3>Submit a full application</h3>
<p>The RPA will be in touch when the full application period opens. They will tell you if your project scored well enough to get the full application form.</p>
<P>You should read the <a href="#" class="govuk-link govuk-link--no-visited-state">Farming Transformation Fund Adding Value grant manual</a> before you submit an application.</p>
<p>If you submit an application, RPA will assess it against other projects and value for money. You will not automatically get a grant. The grant is expected to be highly competitive and you are competing against other projects.</p>
<p>If your application is successful, you’ll be sent a funding agreement and can begin work on the project.</p>

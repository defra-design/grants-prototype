<p>Any planning permission must be in place to submit a full application.</p>
<p>You will invalidate your application if you start the project or commit to any costs (such as placing orders) before you receive a funding agreement.</p>
<p>Before you start the project, you can:</p>

<ul>
  <li>get quotes from suppliers</li>
  <li>apply for planning permission (this can take a long time)</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply-for-a-grant">How to apply for a grant</h2>
<h3>Check if your project can apply for a grant</h3>
<p class="govuk-!-padding-top-3">You need to <a href="start">check if you’re eligible and how well your project fits the funding priorities.</a></p>
<p>You’ll need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>information about your business (for example number of employees, turnover)</li>
  <li>information about the project (for example volume of slurry or digestate)</li>
  <li>a list of the items you’d like to buy for the project</li>
  <li>an estimate of the total cost of the items</li>
</ul>

<p>After you have gone through the checker, you’ll get a score showing how well your project fits the funding priorities.</p>
<p>RPA wants to fund projects that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>improve productivity</li>
  <li>improve the environment</li>
  <li>improve water sustainability</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are happy with your score, you can submit your details to the RPA.</p>
<p>You can go back through the checker as many times as you like but you can only submit your details once.</p>

<h3>Submit a full application</h3>
<p>The RPA will be in touch once the application period opens.</p>
<p>They will tell you if your project scored well enough to get the full application form.</p>
<p>Value for money will be assessed alongside the funding priorities at full application stage and this may impact your overall project score.</p>
<p>The likelihood of a full application being successful will also depend on the number and value of applications we receive.</p>
<p>If you submit a full application and it is successful, you’ll be sent a funding agreement and can begin work on the project.</p>

## Web access

https://grants-prototype2.herokuapp.com/

## Notes for contributors

To contribute to the prototype make sure to work on a branch. You may merge your own branches to `master` and resolve conflicts without a reviewer.

### Branch naming conventions

Name your branch something human-readable that includes your name and describes the work you are performing, for example, `mark-adding-validation` or `suzy-v4-content-amends`

### Deployments

The prototype is deployed through Heroku, under the project name `grants-prototype2`. To deploy the `master` branch, first make sure you have installed the [Heroku CLI tools](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) then run `$ heroku login`. Once you are logged in you should remain logged in and you should not need to do this again unless you are cloning the repo again.

#### Deployment steps

1. Make changes, commit and merge them following the standard git practices.
2. Run `$ heroku git:remote -a grants-prototype2`
3. Run `$ git push heroku master`

Once these steps have been performed you should see the terminal output the deployment status, once this is complete the changes will be live at the access URL (above).

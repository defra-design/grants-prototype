Following a security incident, Heroku has temporarily stopped GitHub repositories automatically deploying to Heroku or deploying through its dashboard. Heroku discovered unauthorised access to its GitHub account on 13 April 2022. As a result, it revoked all existing tokens from the Heroku GitHub integration and new OAuth tokens cannot be created until further notice. Heroku continues to investigate the incident.
